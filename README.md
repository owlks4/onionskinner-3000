# Onionskinner 3000

A small web app that allows the user to take photos with their webcam, and overlay these photos back onto the video feed as ghostly 'onionskin' images.

This process is typically used for stop motion animation, but can also be used as a reference for creating composite photos. But I couldn't find a simple utility that allowed you to pick and choose multiple images from a roster of recent images with ease, so I wrote this.
