# Onionskinner 3000

A small web app that allows the user to take photos with their webcam and overlay these photos back onto the video feed - as ghostly 'onionskin' images.

This is a process that is typically used for stop motion animation, but can also be used as a reference for creating composite photos. I couldn't find a simple utility that allowed you to pick and choose multiple images from a roster of recent images with ease, so I wrote this.
